#Conclusion
• The control people have more history of the past as their results of their previous tests and new tests were correlated. But this is not the case for participants with autism.
• Autistics can gain much better result as they focus and do more tests. However, the participants in control group after the test number 3 gained significantly less points and it seems they get tired sooner than autistics.
